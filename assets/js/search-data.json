            "content": "Overview . Why should I do this? . Because it looks cool? Duh. . . Setup . As it’s own blog page . 1: New post . Create a new .md file in _posts. | . 2: Add code . Go to this link and copy the code from the file and paste it into your new .md file. | . . 3: Enjoy . Look at the new page. | . . As your home page background (May not work with Vunsh’s dark mode) . 1: Locate . You need to go to your _layouts folder and click on home.html. | . 2: Add code . Go to this link and copy the code from the file and paste it at the bottom in the specific location marked. | . . 3: Enjoy . Look at your homepage. | . . How do I play with my solar system? . Manipulating time . In the top-right of the screen there should be a single slider, simulationSpeed. The slider measures how much time in the simualtion will pass every real-time second. . Looking around . Using your mouse or trackpad, click the screen and drag. If the simulation is your homepage background then you CAN NOT move the simulation manually. . Specifying which planet the camera orbits . A dropdown should be present in the top-right of your screen called Camera Target. Select your planet from that drop down and the camera will start tracking that planet instead. . How do I customize it? . This is where the real fun begins. The simulation is pre-built with our solar system as it was in the year 2000 (Pluto is included :D). . . Adding planets . Add planets with this simple line of code: . addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(name, radius, mass (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s))); . The name is pretty staightforward. Example: . // Earth addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(&#39;Earth&#39;, mass, weight (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s))); . The radius is the radius of the object in meters. Example: . // 6371000 // in meters addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(&#39;Earth&#39;, 6371000, weight (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s))); . The mass is the mass of the object in kilograms. Planets have A LOT of mass so I reccomend using scientific notation. Example: . // 5.972e24 // in kilograms addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(&#39;Earth&#39;, 6371000, 5.972e24, position (m), velocity (m/s))); . The position is the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis offset from the origin (0, 0, 0) in meters. The position parameter accepts a list with 3 items. Example: . // [151000000000, 0, 0] // x y z // Each item is in meters addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(&#39;Earth&#39;, 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], velocity (m/s))); . The velocity is the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis velocity in meters per second at the start of the simulation. The velocity parameter accepts a list with 3 items. Example: . // [0, 29785.89, 0] // x y z // Each item is in meters per second addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(&#39;Earth&#39;, 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], [0, 29785.89, 0])); . The final code look something like this: . addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(&#39;Earth&#39;, 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], [0, 29785.89, 0])); . . Planet colors . You can alter a planet’s colors really easily. Example: . // Instead of earth, put the name of your planet earth.color.set(&#39;green&#39;); . . Adjusting a planet’s angular orbit . To alter a planets orbit its a little more complicated. Either you manually add some X, Y or Z velocity, which will make it angled instead of flat, or you can angle it with a special function I added. The reason we use this special function is because of a simple but annoying problem. If you search up the orbital speed of Pluto for example, NASA lists its orbital speed as 3,710 meters per second. The problem with that is Pluto has an orbit angle of 17.14 degrees. The way to get both orbit velocity and orbit angle correct is to rotate the velocity of pluto by 17.14 degrees with the special rotateVector() function. rotateVector() returns a rotated vector. The function has 4 parameters, the vector to rotate, in this case its space.pluto.velocity, and the last 3 are x-rotation, y-rotation and z-rotation. Rotations are in radians, but by using the DEG * Math.PI / 180 formula inside the parameter you can just type in a degree and it’ll be in radians. Example: . pluto.velocity = rotateVector(pluto.velocity, 0, 17.14 * Math.PI / 180, 0); . Since position is also a vector, like velocity, you can apply the rotateVector() function on a planet’s position to get the orbit perfect. You use this to rotate the apex of the orbit. Note space.pluto.position instead of space.pluto.position Example: . pluto.position = rotateVector(pluto.position, 0, 17.14 * Math.PI / 180, 0); . . Removing the GUI (top-right control menu) . Pretty straightforward, this following code snippet just removes the GUI in the top-right. . // Deletes the GUI gui.destroy(); . Adjust start position of camera . . Adjust the camera position to get a better starting angle. This is especially useful for using the solar sytem as your background, as you are unable to rotate the scene manually. . // Changes x, y and z position of the camera. Camera looks to the first astronimal body you add camera.position.set(-150, 150, 270); . . Adjusting constants . The simSpeed constant is the slider in the GUI, it dictates the speed of the simulation. . The gravity constant is the universal graavitational constant, not exactly sure what happens when you mess with it, but you can. . The scale of the simulation. The current scale is pretty good, but if you really want to you can mess with it. . // Three constants you can alter manually constants = { simSpeed: 371, gravity: 66743e-15, scale: 3e-10 } .",

(b) Write the static method dayOfWeek, which returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, 2019 began on a Tuesday, and January 5 is the fifth day of 2019. As a result, January 5, 2019, fell on a Saturday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 5, 2019) returns 6. As another example, January 10 is the tenth day of 2019. As a result, January 10, 2019, fell on a Thursday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 10, 2019) returns 4. In order to calculate this value, two helper methods are provided for you. • firstDayOfYear(year) returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, since 2019 began on a Tuesday, firstDayOfYear(2019) returns 2. • dayOfYear(month, day, year) returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. For the first day of the year, January 1 (month = 1, day = 1), the value 1 is returned. This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example, dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year, while dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year. . public class APCalendar { /** Returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise. */ private static boolean isLeapYear(int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) { int years = 0; for(int i = year1; i &lt; year2; i++;) { isLeapYear(i); } return years; } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, * where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. */ private static int firstDayOfYear(int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. * Returns 1 for January 1 (month = 1, day = 1) of any year. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ private static int dayOfYear(int month, int day, int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { return (dayOfYear(month, day, year) - 1 + firstDayOfYear(year)) % 7; } // There may be instance variables, constructors, and other methods not shown. } .

Points will be awarded on these three key elements . Seeing that you understand how to use Code.org and that you used it to complement your learning on primitives. Up to Lesson 5 in the OOP assignment. Productive Blogging Create a Jupyter Notebook(s) using IJava kernel and that you could use it to capture key learning on Primitives. Create a Jupyter Notebook using Bash and that you could use it to show that you have all the key tools installed. This should also be a Blog for your own personal memory. Each student captures information in Fastpages thinking … how they are going to capture information that will grow to 10 college board units … how they will recognize something as PBL vs College Board. Presentation of Results at Monday meeting. Turn in of Review Ticket (Issue or Fastpages) will be by comment on Fastpages blog: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSA/techtalk/fastpages (Links to an external site.).
