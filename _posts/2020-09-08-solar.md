# Overview
## Why should I do this?
### Because it looks cool? Duh.
<br>

## Setup
### As it's own blog page
- 1: Make new blank post (```.md``` file)
- 2: Copy code from this [link]() into the file
- 3: Enjoy.

<b> 1: New post</b>

- Create a new ```.md``` file in ```_posts```.

<b> 2: Add code</b>

- Go to this [link]() and copy the code from the file and paste it into your new ```.md``` file.

<b> 3: Enjoy </b>

- Look at the new page, it's not that complicated.

<br>

### As your home page background

- 1: Locate a specific section at the bottom of your ```home.html``` file in ```_layouts```
- 2: Copy code from this [link]() into the file at the specific section
- 3: Enjoy.

<b> 1: Locate</b>

- You need to go to your ```_layouts``` folder and click on ```home.html```.

<b> 2: Add code</b>

- Go to this [link]() and copy the code from the file and paste it at the bottom in the specific location marked.

<b> 3: Enjoy </b>

- Look at your homepage, it's not that complicated.

## How do I play with my solar system?
### Manipulating time
In the top-right of the screen there should be a single slider, ```simulationSpeed```. The slider measures how much time in the simualtion will pass every real-time second.
### Looking around
Using your mouse or trackpad, click the screen and drag. <b>If the simulation is your homepage background then you CAN NOT move the simulation manually.</b>
### Specifying which planet the camera orbits
A dropdown should be present in the top-right of your screen called ```Camera Target```. Select your planet from that drop down and the camera will start tracking that planet instead.
## How do I customize it?
This is where the real fun begins. The simulation is pre-built with our solar system as it was in the year 2000 (Pluto is included :D).

<b>Adding planets</b>

Add planets with this simple line of code:
```javascript

    addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(name, radius, mass (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```name``` is pretty staightforward. Example:
```javascript

    // Earth

     addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', mass, weight (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```radius``` is the radius of the object in meters. Example:
```javascript

    // 6371000 
    // in meters

     addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, weight (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```mass``` is the mass of the object in kilograms. Planets have A LOT of mass so I reccomend using scientific notation. Example:
```javascript

    // 5.972e24 
    // in kilograms 

     addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```position``` is the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis offset from the origin (0, 0, 0) in meters. The position parameter accepts a list with 3 items. Example:
```javascript

    // [151000000000, 0, 0]
    //       x        y  z
    // Each item is in meters

     addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```velocity``` is the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis velocity in meters per second at the start of the simulation. The velocity parameter accepts a list with 3 items. Example:
```javascript

    // [0, 29785.89, 0]
    //  x      y     z
    // Each item is in meters per second

     addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], [0, 29785.89, 0]));

```

The final code look something like this:
```javascript

     addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], [0, 29785.89, 0]));

```
