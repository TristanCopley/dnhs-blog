# Overview
## Why should I do this?
### Because it looks cool? Duh.
<br>

## Setup
### As it's own blog page
- 1: Make new blank post (```.md``` file)
- 2: Copy code from this [link]() into the file
- 3: Enjoy.

<b> 1: New post</b>

- Create a new ```.md``` file in ```_posts```.

<b> 2: Add code</b>

- Go to this [link]() and copy the code from the file and paste it into your new ```.md``` file.

<b> 3: Enjoy </b>

- Look at the new page, it's not that complicated.

<br>

### As your home page background

- 1: Locate a specific section at the bottom of your ```home.html``` file in ```_layouts```
- 2: Copy code from this [link]() into the file at the specific section
- 3: Enjoy.

<b> 1: Locate</b>

- You need to go to your ```_layouts``` folder and click on ```home.html```.

<b> 2: Add code</b>

- Go to this [link]() and copy the code from the file and paste it at the bottom in the specific location marked.

<b> 3: Enjoy </b>

- Look at your homepage, it's not that complicated.

## How do I play with my solar system?
### Manipulating time
In the top-right of the screen there should be a single slider, ```simulationSpeed```. The slider measures how much time in the simualtion will pass every real-time second.
### Looking around
Using your mouse or trackpad, click the screen and drag. <b>If the simulation is your homepage background then you CAN NOT move the simulation manually.</b>
### Specifying which planet the camera orbits
A dropdown should be present in the top-right of your screen called ```Camera Target```. Select your planet from that drop down and the camera will start tracking that planet instead.
## How do I customize it?
This is where the real fun begins. The simulation is pre-built with our solar system as it was in the year 2000 (Pluto is included :D).

<b>Adding planets</b>

Add planets with this simple line of code:
```javascript

addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject(name, radius, mass (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```name``` is pretty staightforward. Example:
```javascript

// Earth

addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', mass, weight (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```radius``` is the radius of the object in meters. Example:
```javascript

// 6371000 
// in meters

addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, weight (kg), position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```mass``` is the mass of the object in kilograms. Planets have A LOT of mass so I reccomend using scientific notation. Example:
```javascript

// 5.972e24 
// in kilograms 

addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, position (m), velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```position``` is the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis offset from the origin (0, 0, 0) in meters. The position parameter accepts a list with 3 items. Example:
```javascript

// [151000000000, 0, 0]
//       x        y  z
// Each item is in meters

addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], velocity (m/s)));

```

The ```velocity``` is the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis velocity in meters per second at the start of the simulation. The velocity parameter accepts a list with 3 items. Example:
```javascript

// [0, 29785.89, 0]
//  x      y     z
// Each item is in meters per second

addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], [0, 29785.89, 0]));

```

The final code look something like this:
```javascript

addAstronomicalObject(new AstronomicalObject('Earth', 6371000, 5.972e24, [151000000000, 0, 0], [0, 29785.89, 0]));

```

<b>Planet colors</b>

You can alter a planet's colors really easily. Example:
```javascript

// Instead of earth, put the name of your planet

space.earth.color.set('green');

```

<b>Adjusting a planet's angular orbit</b>

To alter a planets orbit its a little more complicated. Either you manually add some X, Y or Z velocity, which will make it angled instead of flat, or you can angle it with a special function I added. The reason we use this special function is because of a simple but annoying problem. If you search up the orbital speed of Pluto for example, NASA lists its orbital speed as 3,710 meters per second. The problem with that is Pluto has an orbit angle of 17.14 degrees. The way to get both orbit velocity and orbit angle correct is to rotate the velocity of pluto by 17.14 degrees with the special ```rotateVector()``` function. ```rotateVector()``` returns a rotated vector. The function has 4 parameters, the vector to rotate, in this case its ```space.pluto.velocity```, and the last 3 are x-rotation, y-rotation and z-rotation. Rotations are in radians, but by using the ```DEG * Math.PI / 180``` formula inside the parameter you can just type in a degree and it'll be in radians. Example:

```javascript

space.pluto.velocity = rotateVector(space.pluto.velocity, 0, 17.14 * Math.PI / 180, 0);

```

Since ```position``` is also a vector, like velocity, you can apply the ```rotateVector()``` function on a planet's position to get the orbit perfect. You use this to rotate the apex of the orbit. Note ```space.pluto.position``` instead of ```space.pluto.position``` Example:
```javascript

space.pluto.position = rotateVector(space.pluto.position, 0, 17.14 * Math.PI / 180, 0);

```
