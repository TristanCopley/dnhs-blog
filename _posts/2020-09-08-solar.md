## How do I play with my solar system?
### Manipulating time
In the top-right of the screen there should be a single slider, ```simulationSpeed```. The slider measures how much time in the simualtion will pass every real-time second.
### Looking around
Use your mouse and click the screen and drag. <b>If the simulation is your homepage background then you CAN NOT move the simulation manually.</b>
### Specifying which planet to look at
A dropdown should be present in the top right
## How do I customize it?
### Adding new planets and objects
### Altering physics
